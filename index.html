    <p class = "intro-para">Since its founding, Phi Kappa Phi has initiated more than 1.5 million 
      members into its ranks; all of these members have received emblems and certificates of 
      membership. However, Phi Kappa Phi is much more than an emblem and a line on résumé. 
      It is a global network composed of the best and brightest from all academic disciplines 
      - a community of scholars and professionals building an enduring legacy for future generations.</p>

  <h2 id = "history">Mission and History</h2>

  <p class = "para">The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi is the nation's oldest, largest, and most selective 
    all-discipline honor society. Founded in 1897 at the University of Maine, the distinguishing 
    characteristic of Phi Kappa Phi is its belief that all branches of higher education merit
    recognition. It extends its interest and eligibility across the entire range of academic inquiry and
    calls attention to the fact that today's world needs a breadth of understanding far beyond that of a
    specialist who restricts his or her outlook to a single area of study. As the core of its mission,
    Phi Kappa Phi annually award nearly $1 million each year in scholarships and other grants through 
    the Society and its Chapters.<br><br>
    The Society's mission statement is "to recognize and promote academic excellence in all fields of 
    higher education and to engage the community of scholars in service to others."</p>

  <h3>Orginization History</h3>

  <p class = "para">In 1897, 10 senior students, 2 faculty members and the University of Maine president created
    a new kind of honor society that recognized excellence in all academic disciplines. 
    Under the leadership of student Marcus L. Urann, the group formed the Lambda Sigma Eta Society,
    later renamed Phi Kappa Phi from the letters of the Greek words forming its motto, <em>Philosophía Krateítõ Phõtôn</em>,
    "Let the love of learning rule humanity.”<br><br>Today, the Society of Phi Kappa Phi annually inducts approximately 30,000
    students, faculty, professional staff, and alumni. Once inducted, Phi Kappa Phi members gain a lifelong passport to a
    global network of academic and professional opportunities.</p>

  <h3>U-M Chapter History</h3>
  <p class = "para"> For five consecutive years since 2010, the University of Michigan has received the Society's prestigious
    Chapter of Excellence Award, one of only a handful chapters in Phi Kappa Phi history to achieve this distinction. Along with
    top students in the University, chapter members include President Mark Schlissel, former President Mary Sue Coleman,
    Provost Martha Pollack, several Deans and Distinguished University Professors. In support of Phi Kappa Phi's Mission to uplift 
    academic excellence, the U-M Chapter has awarded a total of $150,000 to its student members since 2008 towards educational, professional,
    and research pursuits.</p>
